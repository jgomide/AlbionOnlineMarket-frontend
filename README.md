# AlbionOnlineMarket

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.9.

A front-end Web Project using Angular that shows prices and market information of items in the game [Albion Online](https://albiononline.com/en/home). This project is based on a back-end project called [The Albion Online Data Project](https://www.albion-online-data.com/) written in C# .Net. They extract the data from the game Albion Online and make it available through a web api. 

This project is still in early stages of development and further information updates will release soon.
